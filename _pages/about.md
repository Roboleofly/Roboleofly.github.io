I'm interested in the artificial intelligence application in robotics. 

# About me 
I'm  pursuing for master's degree at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and focused on Artificial Intelligence Robotics. I am passionate about developing innovative algorithms and leveraging data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems. Previously, I interned at the AI Research Institute of iFlytek, where I focused on humanoid robot locomotion and stabilization using reinforcement learning for nine months. Currently, I am interning at the National and Local Co-Built Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robotics Innovation Center, where I contribute to advancing embodied AI and robotics technologies.
